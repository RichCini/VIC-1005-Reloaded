# VIC-1005-Reloaded
The VIC-1005R is a 3-slot expansion backplane for the VIC-20 computer system.

The VIC-1005R (Reloaded) is a reimagination of the original but customized
for the various "reloaded" VIC-20s that have a vertical (Atari 2600-like)
expansion connector. It uses two boards -- the expansion connector board
and the multi-slot backplane -- connected by a 2x25 IDC ribbon cable.
It includes a reset switch and separate fuse to protect the backplane.
